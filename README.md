### About Me
I'm a Computer Science major interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and exploring how AI is impacting the industry. I also have experience with web development, both front-end and back-end. Although my knowledge in the aforementioned areas of study is limited, I'm eager to learn more about them. Now, for the question every developer gets: "What's your favorite programming language to code in?" I don't have a specific one, but I tend to use Java, Python, and JavaScript frequently. If you're still reading my about me at this point, I want to thank you for being here and hope that you continue reading the bullet points containing some more facts about me below:

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning ...

  <li>Spring Boot</li>
  <li>React JS</li>
</ul>
ðŸš€ Iâ€™m looking to join new projects and collaborate with fellow developers!
<br />
<br />
ðŸ‘¯ In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, grinding Geometry Dash, and practicing the violin!
