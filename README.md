### About Me
I'm a Computer Science major interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and exploring how AI is shaping our world. I also have experience with web development, both front-end and back-end. Although my knowledge in the aforementioned areas of study is limited, I'm eager to learn more about them. Now, for the question every developer gets: "What's your favorite programming language?" I don't have a specific one, but I tend to use Java, Python, and JavaScript the most. If you're still reading my about me at this point, I want to thank you for being here and hope that you continue reading the bullet points below to learn more about me:
